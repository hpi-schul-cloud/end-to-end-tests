Feature: Creating a task as a teacher

   As a teacher on Schul-Cloud
   I want to be able to create a task after logging in with a teacher account

   Scenario Outline: The user logs in as a teacher and creates a simple task
   When a teacher logs in his account using <username> and <password> in order to create a task
   When the teacher has accepted the data protection agreement
   Then he should click the task-button in the dashboard-sidebar
   Then he should click the create-task-button on the task page
   Then he should put the taskname <taskname> into the name field
   Then he should put the taskBody <taskBody> into the body field
   Then he should click the submit-task-button on the task-creation-form
   Then teacher goes to tasks page
   Then he should see the created task with the name <taskname> on the task page

   Examples:
   | username | password | taskname | taskBody |
   | lehrer@schul-cloud.org  | Schulcloud1!  | IntegrationTestAufgabe  | MyBody |
