Feature: Administrate pupils, classes and teachers
	As an admin on Schul-Cloud
	I want to be able to administrate pupils, teachers and classes
	
	Background:
		Given admin arrives on the Schul-Cloud homepage

	Scenario Outline: Admin creates a pupil

		# When admin goes to administration
		# When an admin puts in <firstName> and <secondName> and <email> of the new pupil
		# Then the admin should see new pupil with email <email> among his pupils
		# # Then the teacher can manually submit a consent <email>
		# # Then new pupil can log in
		# # Then new pupil accepts data protection policy and sets new password for the profile
=======
		When admin logs in with email <adminsUsername> and password <password>
		Then admin goes to administration
		And an admin puts in <firstName> and <secondName> and <email> of the new pupil
		And the admin should see new pupil with email <email> among his pupils
		And admin manually submits a consent <email>
		And admin logs out
		#Then new pupil can log in
		#Then new pupil accepts data protection policy and sets new password for the profile
