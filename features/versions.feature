@nuxtversion
Scenario:
  When a user arrives on the nuxt version page
  Then he should see the git sha

# because the other ones need a special build step that is not in the Dockerfiles yet

# @clientversion
# Scenario:
#   When a user arrives on the client version page
#   Then he should see the git sha

# @serverversion
# Scenario:
